# Architecture Example

This project demonstrates the use of design patterns and architectural solutions in the context of C# development with Unity. The main goal of the project is to showcase development skills, code structuring, and the application of modern approaches to creating flexible and scalable applications.

## Description

The project implements a chain for initializing game services and interfaces using the **Chain of Responsibility** pattern. This allows the initialization logic to be divided into independent modules that can be easily extended or modified.

### Main Components

- **CoreChainsInitializer**: The main class responsible for starting the initialization chain.
- **ServicesInitChain**: A chain node responsible for initializing services.
- **MainMenuChain**: A chain node responsible for initializing the main menu.
- **CoreChainsData**: A data class passed through the chain to configure initialization.

## Design Patterns Used

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Allows requests to be passed along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it further.
- **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies dependency management between components.
- **Data Transfer Object (DTO)**: The `CoreChainsData` class is used to transfer data between chain nodes.

## Advantages

- **Modularity**: Each chain node is responsible for its part of the logic, simplifying maintenance and testing.
- **Extensibility**: New nodes can be added to the chain without modifying existing code.
- **Flexibility**: Initialization logic can be easily changed or adapted to new requirements.

## How to Use

1. Add the `CoreChainsInitializer` to an object in the Unity scene.
2. Configure the initialization chain by adding or modifying nodes.
3. Run the project to see how the chain processes data and performs initialization.

## Project Goal
This project was created to demonstrate development skills and can be used as part of a portfolio. It showcases the ability to work with design patterns, structure code, and develop scalable solutions.

## Requirements
Unity 2021.3 or higher
.NET Framework 4.x or higher

## Code Example

```csharp
public void Awake()
{
    ServicesInitChain initChain = new ServicesInitChain();
    MainMenuChain mainMenuChain = new MainMenuChain();

    CoreChainsData data = new CoreChainsData()
    {
        IsDebugMode = false
    };

    initChain.SetNext(mainMenuChain);
    initChain.Handle(data);
}
